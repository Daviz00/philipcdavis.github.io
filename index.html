  <h2 class="mb1">Hello, i’m Philip. Nice to meet you.</h2>
  <p class="mt0">
    I’m a product designer, and web developer working at Apple in Cupertino.
There, I spend my time building design systems and making intentional design decisions. Reading, writing, and listening are the skills under my other skills. If you would like to get in touch, reach out on twitter or send me an email.

  <h3>Writing</h3>
  <p class="mt0">
    The discapline of writing is important for a designer. The designer needs to get ideas out of the head into an orginized place where they can be evaluated.
    <blockquote>The act of composition, or creation, disciplines the mind; writing is one way to go about thinking, and the practice and habit of writing not only drain the mind but supply it, too. — Strunk and White</blockquote>
