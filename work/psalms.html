<p>
    I started working on this project in January of 2010 while I was a sophmore in college.
    The basic idea was that I was going to design through each chapter of psalms.
    Drawing inspiration from the passage I was reading. All the original designs are still hosted <a href="http://blog.pettydesigner.com">here</a>.
