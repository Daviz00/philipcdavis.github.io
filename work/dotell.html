    During the summer of 2011 I joined Network Solutions as a front end developer intern.
    I was tasked with designing and developing an app with two back end developers.
    QR codes were hot stuff, and so we decided to build an app that allowed small business get feedback from customers.
    You can watch the video below to get a better feel for what we built.
