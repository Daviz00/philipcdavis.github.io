<p>
  I have been working on Semoss as a designer, developer, data visualizer.
  Semoss is an context aware analytics tool that allows you to identify multi-dimensional transitive relationships.
  Much of my work has been building a web application using <a href="https://angularjs.org/">angular</a> and creating data visualizations using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a>.
  I have also done a lot of design work including icon, brand, and interface design.
  Below is a smorgasbord sampling of things I have built.
