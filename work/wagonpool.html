    I built Wagon Pool in order to teach myself iOS development and design.
    It's a simple carpooling calculator that allows you to find out how much a trip will cost each person involved.
    It's available on the app store and can be downloaded via its <a href="http://www.wagonpool.com">landing page</a>.
    You can also read more about <a href="{{ "/notebook/making-wagonpool" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">how I built Wagon Pool</a>.
