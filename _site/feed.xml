        <title>How to Become a Front End Developer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently taught a front end intensive course to people who had no coding experience.
Here are three thoughts I would share with new or future front end developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-confidence&quot;&gt;Technical confidence.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started it’s easy to feel overwhelmed.
It’s important to remember that a lot of front end developers are self taught.
If you are self motivated, and have time and energy to devote you can overcome the barriers to this field.
A great place to begin is with a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Learning these will build your confidence and allow your to explore other languages, and frameworks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mental-grit&quot;&gt;Mental grit.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are moments in your work where you aren’t eager to learn new things.
&lt;a href=&quot;../Staying-Engaged/&quot;&gt;Staying engaged with your work&lt;/a&gt; is important for those getting started because it’s easier to drop out.
You need to position yourself so that you don’t get stuck for long.
Make sure your expectations are realistic enough to overcome the hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creative-outlets&quot;&gt;Creative Outlets.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the skills you are learning and put them to work.
Building and shipping is a great way to learn.
If you can’t do this at your job, create side projects.
You need to have creative drive that keeps you engaged and hungry to learn.
Devour resources and never stop exploring the terrain because it changes fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can capitalize on one of the most enjoyable professions around right now if you approach it with the right attitudes. 
You need the confidence that allows you undertake this education and the humility to know you will get stuck along the way.
Start with the essentials and keep creating new things.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Staying Engaged With Your Work</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There will always be seasons when you lose motivation to do your work with excellence.
When it happens, it means something needs to change, either in your attitude or in the work itself.
You have to stay engaged with your work to thrive in your career.
Here are some things that have helped me through droughts of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-let-your-work-define-you&quot;&gt;Don’t let your work define you.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look to your job to provide meaning and significance it will let you down.
Your work is important, but it’s not your identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-side-project&quot;&gt;Create a side project.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side projects give you the freedom to define the rules and explore the things you want to learn.
I always have 1-2 side projects that relate to my work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;surround-yourself-with-passionate-people&quot;&gt;Surround yourself with passionate people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You are the average of the five people that you spend the most time with.
-  Jim Rohn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivation is contagious. Find people who love what they do and spend lots of time with them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Art of Listening</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years i’ve realized how much I dislike listening in one on one conversations and how much I enjoy attention.
This destructive tendency can jeopardize any relationship which is why I have been fighting it. 
I’ve learned a few things along the way that have helped me become a better listener. I hope they help you as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-genuinely-interested-in-people&quot;&gt;Be genuinely interested in people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you really don’t care about a story or opinion.
It’s important to take interest in the person sharing them.
Caring for people allows me to enjoy stories that I don’t find exciting, or opinions that I am indifferent to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;follow-up-with-questions&quot;&gt;Follow up with questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following up is about asking relevant and helpful questions.
It can be very easy to kill a conversation. People know when their words aren’t appreciated.
I’ve found that asking questions is a more effective way of engaging others than offering advice or opinions.
Have them flesh out their thoughts or give examples.
It shows that you are engaged and allows meaningful conversational to take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;give-people-time&quot;&gt;Give people time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the best thoughts out of people, don’t pressure them to talk faster than they are comfortable with.
I am trying to wait for a minimum of 3-5 seconds of silence before I respond.
I used to feel awkward about this, But a quick nod fills this time and serves as a transition to a shift in conversation.
If you are talking with someone who wants to have 100% of the time to talk, be generous and give it to them.
Playing tug of war in a conversation makes for a frustrating experiance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoning out and interrupting will kill your conversations.
Appreciation and generosity will pump life into them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beginning Again</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I needed to redo my website for a lot of reasons. The most important being speed.
My previous website was awfully slow.
There were lots of reasons why that was, the most important being lots of huge uncompressed images.
There is still work to be done, but already the speed index has gone from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webpagetest.org/result/140602_PK_24V/&quot;&gt;9295&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webpagetest.org/result/140602_82_246/&quot;&gt;634&lt;/a&gt;.
Still working on making the reading experience optimal.
If you notice anything funky, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philipcdavis/philipcdavis.github.io/issues&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/philipcdavis&quot;&gt;I would love to hear from you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
