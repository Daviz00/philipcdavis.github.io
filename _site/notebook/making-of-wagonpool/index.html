    <h2>The Making Of Wagon Pool</h2>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>I made my first app this past year. It’s a <a href="http://www.wagonpool.com/">simple carpooling calculator</a> built to help you figure out how much each person owes. 
While it’s still fresh in my mind I wanted to document the process I took in building it.
This post may be helpful for you if you want to teach yourself how to make mobile applications.</p>

<p>If you don’t know me, I’m a designer and front end developer.
I designed and built Wagon Pool from scratch without any previous Objective C, Xcode, or Object Oriented Programming experience.</p>

<h3 id="my-goals">My Goals</h3>
<p>My hope for this project was that I would be able to ship something I was proud of.
I wanted the app to be easy to use, focused, better than alternative options.</p>

<p>I also wanted to have a good understanding of what it takes to build an iOS application.
I needed to learn Object Oriented Programming and learn mobile development on its own terms.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started:</h3>
<p>I found a 99 cent notebook to help organize my thoughts. In it, I sketched, illustrated, and diagrammed my way through the entire process.
This allowed my to free up mental space and visualize what was going on in my head.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/dist/posts/wagon-notepad.jpg" alt="Notebook" title="Notebook" /></p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>I wanted this app to look nice and to make calculating how much each person owed quick and easy.
I spent a lot of time thinking about how I wanted the users to input information.
I mocked up 8 different ways the interface could work. This forced me to look at the interface long enough to understand the pros and cons of various approaches.
<img src="/assets/dist/posts/wagon-mockups.jpg" alt="Mockups" title="Mockups" />
I used the last option as a starting point because I liked how it allowed the used to get fast estimates without having to type or switch pages.</p>

<p>I made something simple for the icon which I was planning on using.
My friend challenged me to push myself and make something memorable.
I sketched out lots of ideas some of which looked great at 512x512, but poor on the actual device.
After much tweaking I came up with something I think worked well.</p>

<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>Coding Wagon Pool was one of the hardest and greatest things I have done.
So many hours went into such a small app.</p>

<p>I started getting comfortable with Xcode by creating outlets, simple methods, and using the interface builder.
Building a working version didn’t take long but there was a lot wrong. Everything was inside my view controller.
I had read that you shouldn’t cram everything inside there, but I didn’t know where else to put it.
There was also a lot of duplicate code that I didn’t know what to do with.</p>

<p>I decided to go through the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-7-apps-for/id733644550">Stanford course</a> on iTunes University.
The lectures were great, but I didn’t get much out of them because they assumed fundamental OOP understanding.
Seven lectures in, I decided I needed something else.</p>

<p>I read Matt Neuburg’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Fundamentals-Objective-C-Basics/dp/1491945575/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409103316&amp;sr=8-2">iOS fundamentals</a> front to back, and took lots of notes.
This was my best investment of time during the whole project.
I especially enjoyed the first 5 chapters where he covered the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming.
At the same time, I was implementing a lot of the things I was learning.
Coding every morning and evening.</p>

<p>Even after I finished the book, there was still a lot of time put into the app.
For better or worse, I let myself go down rabbit holes to better understand MVC patterns, auto layout, delegation, and animation.</p>

<h3 id="ship-it">Ship it</h3>
<p>About 3 months in I signed up for the developer program. I wanted to spend time debugging, learning about memory management, and getting feedback.
When it came to getting feedback I got a lot of opinions. It was important for me to understand the problems underneath suggestions.
The biggest problem was that users didn’t have enough control over their input. I decided to create a modal window that gave users the ability enter in specific values outside the range.
This set me back a few weeks, but i’m glad I decided to address it in the v1.0 release.</p>

<p>After going through the process of uploading it to the app store, it spent a week waiting for review and was accepted the first try!
It’s a small app, but it’s something I am very proud of.
Check it out on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wagon-pool-simple-carpooling/id846135212?mt=8">app store</a> and let me know what you think!</p>
