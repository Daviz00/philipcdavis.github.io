    <h1>How to Decide on a Side Project</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>I love side projects for a host of reasons. 
They give you autonomy, sharpen your skills, and can teach you valuable lessons about building and shipping products.
They can also be uniquely challenging.
Getting started it is important to make smart decisions about what you want to build.
This post outlines how I go about deciding on a good side project.</p>

<p>As with many things, it’s helpful to figure out your end goals.
Mine usually fall into one of two buckets.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I want to learn something that I don’t know very well.</li>
  <li>I want to build something that people will use.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s break these down a bit.</p>

<h2 id="learn-something-new">Learn something new</h2>
<p>I learn new skills best by consistently applying myself.
When I was in college I spent every day for 150 days creating a design based off a chapter in the book of Psalms.
Forcing myself to create and post something every day made me a much better visual designer.
At the beginning it was embarrassing because my work wasn’t good, but the rate of embarrassing content decreased as I went on.
I have tried this technique with other mediums like writing and programming and the results are incredible.
If you decide to go this route don’t be too focused on impressing others.
Focus on shipping your work and allow yourself to explore.</p>

<h2 id="build-something-new">Build something new</h2>
<p>Once you have acquired rare and valuable skills it’s time to put them to use.
Side projects are great places to confirm your ideas if you are interesting in growing into a business.
Even if you aren’t interested in starting a business it’s an amazing experience releasing a product you had full control over.
You end up sharpening your technical skills, marketing chops, product design, and documentation habits.
These types of side projects are much more interesting if they are solving a real problem.
Build something you need yourself, or something you know a lot of other people need.</p>
