    <h2>Hi, I'm Philip</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Philip Davis. I'm a husband, designer, and developer.
      I've spent the past 4+ years designing, coding, learning and teaching.
      Working to improve my taste and skillset.
      Caring about the small things without losing sight of the big picture.
