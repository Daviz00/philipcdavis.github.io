There is tremendous value in writing for yourself.
You aren’t thinking about blog traffic or vanity metrics. You are focused on ideas.

A life shifting idea is more important than a blog post.
Writing will slow you down so you can observe the shape of your idea and flesh it out.

>the act of composition, or creation, disciplines the mind; writing is one way to go about thinking, and the practice and habit of writing not only drain the mind but supply it, too. <br><br> - Strunk and White


Start an anonymous blog.
Put your thoughts in a journal.
Maybe one day you'll share your words, but you don’t have to.
Your writing isn’t wasted.
