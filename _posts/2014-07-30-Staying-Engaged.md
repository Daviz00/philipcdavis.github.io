There will always be seasons when you lose motivation to do your work with excellence.
When it happens, it means something needs to change, either in your attitude or in the work itself.
You have to stay engaged with your work to thrive in your career.
Here are some things that have helped me through droughts of motivation.

## Don't let your work define you.
If you look to your job to provide meaning and significance it will let you down.
Your work is important, but it's not your identity.

## Create a side project.
Side projects give you the freedom to define the rules and explore the things you want to learn.
I always have 1-2 side projects that relate to my work.

## Surround yourself with passionate people

Motivation is contagious. Find people who love what they do and spend lots of time with them.
