I needed to redo my website for a lot of reasons. The most important being speed.
My previous website was awfully slow.
There were lots of reasons why that was, the most important being lots of huge uncompressed images.
There is still work to be done, but already the speed index has gone from [9295](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/140602_PK_24V/) to [634](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/140602_82_246/).
Still working on making the reading experience optimal.
If you notice anything funky, [let me know](https://github.com/philipcdavis/philipcdavis.github.io/issues).
