There will always be lulls when you don't have the motivation to be passionate about the work you are doing.
Maybe no one would notice if you decided to settle for mediocrity. You might convince yourself that it's unavoidable, or not a big deal.
Losing interest in the work you are doing means something needs to change, either in your attitude or in the work itself.
Getting good at your job means you have to stay engaged.
Here are some things that have helped me through the motivation droughts.

###Don't let your work define you.
If you look to your job to provide meaning and significance it will let you down.
Your work is important, but if it takes over your identity it can disillusion you.

###Create a side project. 
Working on side projects gives you the freedom to define the rules and explore the tools you want to learn.
I try to always have 1-2 side projects that relate to my work. 

###Surround yourself with passionate people

> -  Jim Rohn

If you spend all your time with people who don't care about their work it won't be long before you feel the same way.
Your friends don't even need to be passionate about the same field of work. 
I am often encouraged to work to the best of my ability by friends in different career paths.
