I needed to redo my website for a lot of reasons. The most important being speed.
My previous website ([still hosted](http://pettydesigner.com/)) was awfully slow.
There were lots of reasons why that was, the most important being lots of huge uncompressed images.
There is still work to be done, but already the speed index has gone from [9295](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/140602_PK_24V/) to [635](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/140602_82_246/).

###Built on Jekyll
This site is built on top of ([Jekyll](jekyllrb.com)).
I was originally going to use it solely for the blog, but I figured I could reuse the includes and layout styles for the other pages.
I really like how much control it gives you over everything, it feels like a great lightweight solution for me.
Still working on making the reading experience optimal. Trent Walton's [fluid type][1] has been a great resource for me.
If you notice anything funky, ([Let Me Know](https://github.com/philipcdavis/philipcdavis.github.io/issues)).
