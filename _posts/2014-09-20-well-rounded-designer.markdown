> Find the things that won't change in your business and invest heavily in those things. - Jeff Bezos

Bezos' quote resonates with me on many levels but I think there's an important takeaway for designers.
Are we investing into skills that are going to be relevant in 20 years?
Here are a few communication skills that I am focusing on right now in my career.

##Persuasion.
Designers spend a lot of time reassuring, explaining, and defending design decisions.
Persuasion is not the same thing as deception, its about sharing ideas in a winsome way.
The ability to get people excited about an idea is of tremendous value.

##Listening.
We need to make sure our solutions are for real people.
Spend time with the people who use what you create.
Listen for the pain points, it's up to us to create solutions.

##Teaching.
When I teach a subject, it forces me learn the material inside and out.
I'm challenged to boil down concepts so that they are easy to explain and understand.
Technical jargon can be a cover up for insecurity.
Oftentimes what sounds smart isn't helpful.
