I love side projects for a host of reasons. 
They give you autonomy, boost your skills, and allow you to experiment with tools and processes.
They can also be uniquely challenging. 
With all the freedom and its benefits you also need to make hard decisions about what to build. 
This post is collection of my thoughts on deciding on a side project.


##Solve a real problem
Maybe you have acquired rare and valuable skills and you want to use them to solve a problem.
Make sure it's a real one. The easiest way to know its a real problem is if it's your problem.
You don't always have that luxury though. The other way I validate problems is by waiting until 3+ people approach me with the same problem.
Responsive Resume came about this way. I had friends who kept asking me for a way to put something professional online.
I didn't have anything to recommend and I needed the template for myself so I created it.
I abstracted what I built for myself and then branded it as something others could use. I knew it was useful because I used it myself.


##Learn something new
Maybe you don't have any ideas, but you know you want teach yourself something new.
One good way to sharpen your skills is by consistently applying yourself.
When I was in college I spent every day for 150 days creating a design based off a chapter in the book of Psalms.
Forcing myself to create and post something every day made me a much better designer.
At the beginning it was embarrassing because my work wasn't good, but the amount of embarrassing content decreased as I went on.
I have tried this technique with other mediums like writing and programming and the results are incredible. 


I was able to do both of these things with Wagon Pool, the first iPhone app I created.
I wanted to learn iOS development and at the same time i wanted to create something my friends needed.
In all cases it should be something you get excited about.  
If you aren't proud of what you are working on, it probably isn't worth it.
