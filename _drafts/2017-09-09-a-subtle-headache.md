# A Subtle Headache

The aim of this post is to convince you to start now. As I write this, I have a small but present headache. It’s the type of headache that isn’t crippling, but uncomfortable. It’s enough to convince me I don’t need to write, I just need to relax. Nonsense. It’s time to start. Start your book, business, or ballad.

> Their are always plenty of rivals to our work. We are always falling in love or quarreling, looking for jobs or fearing to lose them, getting ill and recovering, following public affairs. If we let ourselves we shall always be waiting for some distraction or other to end before we can really get down to our work.

I have the time, health, and resources — I don’t need to wait for inspiration. Inspiration tiptoe behind me to my cave where i’ll sit down, open my computer, and slay my dragon.

If you are waiting for something, know that you might never get it. You are the steward of every day and every breath. Go forth and slay dragons.
