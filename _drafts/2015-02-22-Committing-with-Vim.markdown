In this quick tip video, I go over how to write your commit message using Vim. It's helpful if you've ever accidentally found yourself stuck in this editor.

To summerize:
<ol>
    <li>Press 'i' to enter insert mode</li>
    <li>Type your commit message</li>
    <li>Press esc to exit insert mode</li>
    <li>Press :x to save the commit and exit vim</li>
</ol>
